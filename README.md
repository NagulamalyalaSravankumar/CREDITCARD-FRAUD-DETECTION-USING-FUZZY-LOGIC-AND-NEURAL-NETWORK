In this project we included best data mining algorithm called “machine learning algorithm”, which is utilized to recognize
the credit card fraud, so initially use this algorithm and it is one of the standard model.
Then,secondly apply the hybrid methods namely, “AdaBoost and majority vote method”. Use this
model efficacy, which is evaluated, and then use the credit card data set it is publicly available
one. The financial institution included true world data set, so it is taking and analyzed. In this
robustness algorithm additionally evaluate the noise added data samples. This concept is used
in experiment and then produce the result positively indicate the hybrid method, that is
majority voting, it provides good accuracy rates in credit card fraud detection.
